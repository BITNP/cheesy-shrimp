冷知识，指的是那些表现为偏门的、琐碎的、庞杂的知识跟事情。这些知识看似有些稀奇古怪，或饶富趣味、并随时充斥在我们的生活周遭，却鲜少人会去注意。

冷知识可以让人增长见识，开阔视野，还能启迪思维，引发强烈求知欲。和“冷笑话”属于另类幽默一样，冷知识虽冷门但有用，且更能吸引人。

Trivia is information and data that are considered to be of little value.[1] It can be contrasted with general knowledge and common sense. The word is derived from the Latin word triviae, meaning a place where a road split into two (thus, creating a three-way intersection). It was introduced into English as the adjective trivial in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Modern usage of the term trivia dates back to the 1960s, when college students introduced question-and-answer contests to their universities. A board game, Trivial Pursuit, was released in 1982 in the same vein as these contests. Since the beginning of its modern usage, trivia contests have been established at various academic levels as well as casual venues such as bars and restaurants.
